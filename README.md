## Project Objectives
i.	To display the count of Covid-19 cases, active cases, critical cases, new deaths, and average deaths across different countries and regions.
ii.	To visualize the spread of Covid-19 on a global map, showing confirmed cases and total deaths by country.
iii.	To provide a user-friendly interface for filtering Covid-19 data by continent and country.
iv.	To offer up-to-date information to aid in the monitoring and decision-making processes regarding the pandemic.

## Project Problem:
The Covid-19 pandemic requires constant and reliable tracking of cases and fatalities to manage and mitigate its impact effectively. However, gathering, updating, and presenting this data in a comprehensive and accessible manner is challenging.

## Project Significance:
The Covid-19 Dashboard Tracker helps in visualizing the real-time status of the pandemic globally. It enables governments, health organizations, researchers, and the public to:
•	Monitor the progression of the virus.
•	Identify regions with high infection rates.
•	Make informed decisions based on the latest data.

## Project Remark
The Covid-19 Dashboard Tracker demonstrates the power of data visualization in managing public health crises. By providing real-time updates and a user-friendly interface, the dashboard ensures that crucial information is readily available to all stakeholders. The use of a global map and detailed statistics helps in understanding the spread and impact of the virus, thereby aiding in the development of targeted interventions.
